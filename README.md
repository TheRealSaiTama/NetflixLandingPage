> A faithful recreation of the Netflix landing page, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  This project focuses on replicating the core layout, design elements, and tab-based content switching of the original Netflix page.

## Features

*   **Responsive Design:**  Adapts to various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile) using media queries.
*   **Visual Fidelity:**  Replicates the Netflix aesthetic, including:
    *   Hero section with a large background image and call-to-action.
    *   Tabbed content area showcasing different features (Cancel anytime, Watch anywhere, Pick your price).
    *   Content sections with images and text descriptions.
    *   A pricing table.
    *   A footer with navigation links.
*   **Interactive Tabs:**  JavaScript is used to switch between the tab content sections.  Clicking a tab displays the corresponding content and highlights the active tab.
*   **Font Awesome Icons:**  Uses Font Awesome for icons (e.g., door-open, tablet-alt, tags, check, times).
*   **Clean CSS:** Uses CSS variables for consistent colors and a well-structured stylesheet.

## Technologies Used

*   **HTML5:**  Semantic HTML for the page structure.
*   **CSS3:**  Styling, layout, and responsive design.  Uses CSS Grid and Flexbox.
*   **JavaScript (ES6+):**  For the tab switching functionality.
*   **Font Awesome:**  For icons.
